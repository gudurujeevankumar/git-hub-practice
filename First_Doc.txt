1. First we want to check git status by using
--> "git status"
2. Then initialise the github working directory by using 
--> "git init -b main" 

Meaning of 
"git    init            -b      main"
"git    initialise      branch  branch name"

3. For every time we have to check status by using 
--> "git status"

4. To add the files from { working directory } to { Staging area }
    we have to use 
    --> "git add file/document_name"
    To add all files we can use {.} "dot"
    --> "git add ."

5. For commit we have to use 
--> "git commit -m "Our message"

6. For skipping the staging for commiting the file then we have to use command 
--> [ git commit -a -m "message" ]

7.For pushing the code from our local repository to remote repository we have to use 
--> "git push origin main"


To see what are the changes that happened in our working directory we can use 
--> "git diff" [It can shows when the file in working directory]
--> "git diff --staged" [It will shows ]
[After running this command in terminal we get the changes that we made in file as in green colour]

Red -- Previous one
Green -- Modified or newly added 

To remove the file or delete the file from staging area by using 
--> git rm --cached file_name

Tags are 2 types - tags is used for version naming like that...

To see tags we have to use 
--> git tags
and for getting detail information about a perticular tag then we have to use 
--> git show tag_name

1.Light weight tags 

2.Annotated Tags - By using this we can give full information of versions 

command --> git tag -a v1.0 -m "message"


-------------------------------------------------------
For cloning the project from remote repository 
we can use 
--> git clone repo-link (http link)

-------------------------------------------------------

Git brach Concept :
----------------

branches is used to experiment or if you don't want main branch to disturb then we can create branch by using command 
--> git checkout -b branch_name

we can create a new branch by using command 
--> git switch -c branch_name

To see all branches that we have by using command called 
--> git branch

To see all branches including remote braches (in repository that was in online)
we can use this command 
--> git branch --all

to shift from present branch to previous branch we can use 
--> git switch -

To delete branch 
----------------
--> git branch -d branch_name 

Merging branches 
----------------
to merge branches we have to switch to main brach
Then
--> git merge branch_name

                    | (git init branch_name)
                    |
    we initialise the git by using branch name      { Working Directory }
                    | 
                    |(git add file_name)
                    |
    we add the file to Staging area                 { Staging Area }
                    |
                    |(git commit -m "message")      ''' to skip staging we have to use -a in front of -m [git commit -a -m "message"]'''
                    |
                    | [Note : If we want to commit the file, then file must be in staging area]
        we can commit the changes                   { Commit History }

                    |
                    |
        Then for pushing the code from { Local to Remote repo}
                    |
                    | (git push origin main)
                    |
