1. First we want to check git status by using
--> "git status"
2. Then initialise the github working directory by using 
--> "git init -b main" 

Meaning of 
"git    init            -b      main"
"git    initialise      branch  branch name"

3. For every time we have to check status by using 
--> "git status"

4. To add the files from { working directory } to { Staging area }
    we have to use 
    --> "git add file/document_name"

5. For commit we have to use 
--> "git commit -m "Our message"

6. For skipping the staging for commiting the file then we have to use command 
--> [ git commit -a -m "message" ]


To see what are the changes that happened in our working directory we can use 
--> "git diff" [It can shows when the file in working directory]
--> "git diff --staged" [It will shows ]
[After running this command in terminal we get the changes that we made in file as in green colour]

Red -- Previous one
Green -- Modified or newly added

                    | (git init branch_name)
                    |
    we initialise the git by using branch name      { Working Directory }
                    | 
                    |(git add file_name)
                    |
    we add the file to Staging area                 { Staging Area }
                    |
                    |(git commit -m "message")      ''' to skip staging we have to use -a in front of -m [git commit -a -m "message"]'''

                    | [Note : If we want to commit it file must be in staging area]
        we can commit the changes                   { Commit History }
